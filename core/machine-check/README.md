# machine-check: a formal verification tool for digital systems

Machine-check is a tool for formal verification of digital system properties, currently in a proof-of-concept stage. Currently, [Computation Tree Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation_tree_logic) properties of hardware systems written in the [Btor2 language](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-96145-3_32) can be verified. In the future, support of more system descriptions is planned, such as machine-code (assembly) and source-code programs.
